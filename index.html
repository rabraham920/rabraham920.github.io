        <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Robin Abraham, and this is my professional portfolio showcasing my computer science projects. 
            My journey through the Computer Science program has been a transformative experience. Throughout this time, 
            I have equipped myself with both technical expertise and problem-solving skills. 
            This ePortfolio allows me to showcase my coursework, strengths, and professional goals, reflecting my growth throughout the program. 
            This professional self-assessment serves as an introduction to my portfolio, highlighting key skills and experiences that make me a strong 
            candidate in the cybersecurity industry. </p>
        <p>Each course I have completed has contributed to my professional development. From courses that cover data structures and algorithms to software engineering 
            projects, cybersecurity concepts, and interactive labs, I have gained the necessary skills to design, develop, and optimize complex systems. 
            My coursework in network security has provided me with a strong foundation in security principles. 
            Learning about secure coding practices has emphasized how important security, performance, and efficiency are in modern software development.</p>
        <p>One of my most impactful courses was Introduction to Computer Networks, which introduced me to the importance of network infrastructure and served as 
            a stepping stone toward a career in cybersecurity. Throughout the course, I was exposed to key cybersecurity concepts and hands-on labs that deepened 
            my understanding of cybersecurity’s role across various industries.</p>
        <p>In addition to developing technical skills, I have gained valuable experience in team collaboration, communicating with stakeholders, software engineering, 
            database management, and security. Understanding Agile development has allowed me to work more efficiently and collaboratively with peers in structured 
            team environments. Additionally, learning how to explain complex technical concepts in a way that makes sense to stakeholders has highlighted the importance 
            of adapting communication for different audiences.</p>
        <p>From a technical perspective, I have strengthened my proficiency in data structures and algorithms, software engineering, database management, and security 
            through my full-stack development and analysis and design courses. My Analysis and Design course showed me the importance of efficient algorithms,
            such as using indexing to optimize database queries, particularly when handling large datasets. The full-stack development class provided valuable experience 
            in integrating software engineering with databases. In this course, I implemented a RESTful API with Express.js, following the best practices in 
            error handling and code design. Additionally, designing a user authentication system with passwords securely stored in MongoDB showcases
            my skills in database management and security. This course gave me hands-on experience with frontend development, backend logic, databases, and security,
            helping me connect theoretical concepts with real-world applications in computer science.</p>
        <p>My ePortfolio reflects my journey in computer science, highlighting my skills in software development, data structures and algorithms, database management, 
            and security. Each artifact represents a key part of my learning experience and growth. Artifacts One and Three come from my Mobile Architect and 
            Programming course, where I built a weight-tracking application on the Android platform. This application is designed for users who want to track 
            their weight and work toward a healthier lifestyle. It allows users to set goal weights, log their daily weight, sign in to their accounts, and receive 
            notifications when they reach their goal weight.</p>
        <p>I enhanced this application by implementing a try-catch statement inside the loginUser method to prevent database-related crashes. This improvement enhances 
            the user experience by displaying an error message instead of abruptly crashing. I optimized query performance by adding indexing and improved error-handling
            mechanisms to enhance the application’s overall stability. Additionally, my enhancements to the Weight Tracking Application further strengthened my skills in
            database management and security, particularly in secure authentication and system stability.</p>
        <p>Artifact Two, from my Analysis and Design course, shows my ability to work with data structures and algorithms. I enhanced this artifact by fixing the partition 
            function in QuickSort, allowing the program to correctly sort data by properly selecting the pivot and efficiently swapping elements. These improvements 
            reinforce my understanding of algorithm optimization, a crucial skill for building high-performance applications.</p>
        <p>Together, these artifacts highlight my growth as a developer, demonstrating my ability to design, develop, optimize, and secure software solutions. 
            Beyond coursework, this portfolio reflects my problem-solving mindset, technical expertise, and preparedness to tackle real-world challenges in software 
            development, full-stack engineering, or cybersecurity.</p>
